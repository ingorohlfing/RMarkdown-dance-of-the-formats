# Intro
This is a simple Rmd-script that is used to illustrate how it can be 
transformed into a plain R script.

## First some code
Load some toy data.

```{r demo-chunk, echo = TRUE}
# load some data
data(mtcars)
```

The dataset has `r nrow(mtcars)` rows (to have some inline code).  
And let's a plot of *miles per gallon* (`mpg`) against weight (`wt`).

```{r }
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
```
